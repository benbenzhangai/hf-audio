# Hugging Face Audio Course

This repository contains the code and notebooks from the [Hugging Face Audio Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter0/introduction). The course explores how transformers can be applied to audio data for various tasks including speech recognition, audio classification, and text-to-speech generation.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several units covering different aspects of audio processing with transformers:

- Unit 1: Audio data fundamentals, processing techniques, and data preparation
- Unit 2: Audio applications and using ðŸ¤— Transformers pipelines for tasks like classification and speech recognition
- Unit 3: Audio transformer architectures and their applications
- Unit 4: Building a music genre classifier
- Unit 5: Speech recognition for transcribing recordings
- Unit 6: Text-to-speech generation
- Unit 7: Building real-world audio applications with transformers

## Environment

All code in this repository was run in July 2025 with the latest setups and dependencies available at the time.

## Notebooks

The repository includes the following notebooks:

- Audio data fundamentals
- Dataset handling
- Audio preprocessing
- Streaming audio data
- Audio applications
- Audio generation
- Transformers for audio
- Classification with pretrained models
- Fine-tuning audio models
